This is a personal project working with a large dataset from the UC Irvine machine learning repository about communities within the United States.
The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR.
The goal of the project is to run a linear regression model using some of the key data within the datset to find statistically significant indicatiors of crime. 
The dependent variable used in this project is ViolentCrimesPerPop, which is represented as numeric data on a scale from 0 to 1.
The independent variables used in this study is as follows (all numeric) :
'racepctblack'
'racePctWhite'
'racePctAsian'
'racePctHisp'
'medIncome'
'PctNotHSGrad'
'PctPopUnderPov'
'PctUnemployed'
'NumImmig'
'RentMedian'
'PopDens'
Using this data I will perform the linear regression model to see which factors are statistically significant in explaining the dependent variable to get an understanding on what causes crime in communities.
As noted we are working with data pertaining to human behavior and psychology, so I expect that the model will not be perfect but will continue to the best of my ability to make an accurate model.
